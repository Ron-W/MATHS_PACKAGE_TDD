# MATHS_PACKAGE_TDD
Practice at using TDD techniques

This project is an initial attempt at programming using the test driven development (TDD) method.
The code under development is a maths library called (rwMaths.c). The initial set of functions to be developed will return the unknown value of the linear equation:
y = mx + c
The project is based on a copy of the SPI Unit test example given in the Atmel Studio (version 7.0). This will be changed to:
1.	add tests and code for the testing of the linear equation functions, and
2.	remove the original code for the SPI test.
Resources: It is thought that the following SlideShare will be used to help in the TDD process: https://www.slideshare.net/amritayan/test-driven-development-in-c
